Mission Statement: To create a dynamic and visually appealing portfolio website showcasing my skills and projects to potential employers and collaborators.

Overview of Changes:

I created this website from scratch utilizing no framwork thus I as began writing code for each of the files these were the initial steps i took for organization and structure:  

HTML file:
Implemented the <nav> tag to store navigation information.
Utilized the <h1> tag for the Title Element.
Created a list of links to sections using <ul> and <li> tags.
Added links using the <a> tag and the href attribute.
Created sections using the <section> tag.
Assigned an id to each section to link it to the navigation bar.
Assigned a class to each section to choose a specific color.
Created card tags to insert information for each section.

CSS File:
Utilized a flexbox layout to place elements horizontally.
Used justify-content property to create space between elements.
Utilized flexbox to bring text and pictures horizontally.
Positioned and adjusted sizes as needed.
Applied a minimum height of 600px to sections using a class.
Created classes for color to easily change the color of each section.
Designed tags and other elements based on given tags with CSS.
Utilized flexboxes when needed for styling.

Changes I wanted to implement or was planning on implementing was javascript functionality to have a backend to store contact info of anyone trying to send a message. Additionally implementing animations and slideshows was another I had in mind in the beginning.

Testing:
During development, I continuously adjusted dimensions, fonts, and images to achieve the desired look. For example, I experimented with different fonts and image placements to find what worked best. This process helped me refine the visual presentation and improve my design skills.

As worked individually, as a result of scheduling issues with my group.
